Lunch In
--------

Lunch In is an Android application designed to help you reduce the amount of money that you spend by eating out for lunch. It works by monitoring your office wifi and tracking whether it is dropped over lunch hour.

You set a savings goal, and the app tells you how close you are to your goal by tracking how many times you have eaten out vs stayed in for lunch.
