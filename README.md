Lunch In
-----------------

Lunch In is an Android application designed to help people reduce the amount of money that they spend by dining out during lunch.  The application works by monitoring a particular wireless network and tracking whether that network is dropped over a specified lunch hour.  This application can help users set savings goals and track how many times a person has eaten out in a given month.
